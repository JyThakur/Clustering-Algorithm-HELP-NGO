# Clustering-Algorithm-HELP-NGO
## This is the dataset of an NGO called HELP International who has decided to provide a data of different countries and asked to perform analysis with model building which could help them to understand and identify countries (on different factors in the dataset) who are in real and urgent need of aid.
## Doing so will help them to disburse the donation of $10 million USD to needy countries in quicker manner.
### After analyzing dataset using graphs and charts, I made a conclusion to use KMeans and Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm to build a model that could answer the problem of NGO.
